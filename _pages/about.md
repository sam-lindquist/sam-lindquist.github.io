I am a Predoctoral Researcher at the UC San Diego Rady School of Management, interested in behavioral economics, political economy, and economic history.

I'm currently working for Professors [Sally Sadoff](https://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/faculty/sally-sadoff.html) and [Alex Wellsjo](https://www.alexwellsjo.com/) on the design and analysis of experiments. Before coming to UCSD, I majored in math and economics at UC Santa Cruz.
